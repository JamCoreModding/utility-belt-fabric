# Utility Belt

_Free your hotbar._

Utility Belt is a mod for the Fabric & Quilt mod loaders that allows you to clean up valuable hotbar space. It is
similar to the Tool Belt mod for Forge.

Utility belts must be crafted and placed into the belt [trinket slot](https://github.com/emilyploszaj/trinkets) in order
to be used.

## Modpack Creators

If you are a modpack creator wishing to modify the list of tools that can be inserted into the utility belt, you may use
the `allow_in_utility_belt` item tag. Hopefully this will be a rare case, as compatibility with other mods should be
automatic ([report it](https://github.com/JamCoreModding/utility-belt/issues/new) if you think something's missing!).
